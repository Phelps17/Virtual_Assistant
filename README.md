# Virtual_Assistant

Virtual Assistant is a python based side-project to explore the capabilities of the Natural Language Toolkit when combined with basic AI. The goal is to achieve simple, human-like question and answer interaction between the user and the computer. Virtual Assistant will make use of various APIs to draw information from, all of which will be called from one central controller using natural language speech-to-text input and naturalized language text-to-speech output. 

Simple user/computer interaction: 
```
User: echo $(date +%x_%r)
Computer: 06/22/2016_11:06:23 PM
```
Goal interaction:
```
User (spoken): "What time is it in Paris?"
Computer (spoken): "It is currently 6:08 AM in Paris, France."
```
